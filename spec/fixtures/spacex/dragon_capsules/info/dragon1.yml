        is a reusable spacecraft developed by SpaceX, an American private space transportation
        company based in Hawthorne, California. Dragon is launched into space by the
        SpaceX Falcon 9 two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle. The Dragon spacecraft was
        originally designed for human travel, but so far has only been used to deliver
        cargo to the International Space Station (ISS)."}'
