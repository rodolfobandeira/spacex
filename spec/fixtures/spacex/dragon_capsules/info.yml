        2 (also Crew Dragon, Dragon V2, or formerly DragonRider) is the second version
        of the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will be a human-rated vehicle. It includes
        a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two SuperDraco engines each,
        which can serve as a launch escape system or launch abort system (LAS). In
        addition, it has much larger windows, new flight computers and avionics, and
        redesigned solar arrays, and a modified outer mold line from the initial cargo
        Dragon that has been flying for several years."}]'
