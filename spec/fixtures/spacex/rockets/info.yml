        is a privately funded next-generation reusable launch vehicle and spacecraft
        system developed by SpaceX. It was announced by Elon Musk in September 2017;
        the first spacecraft prototype was being manufactured as of March 2018 and
        will begin testing in early 2019. The overall space vehicle architecture includes
        both launch vehicles and spacecraft that are intended to completely replace
        all of SpaceX''s existing space hardware by the early 2020s as well as ground
        infrastructure for rapid launch and relaunch, and zero-gravity propellant
        transfer technology to be deployed in low Earth orbit (LEO). The large payload
        to Earth orbit of up to 150,000 kg (330,000 lb) makes BFR a super heavy-lift
        launch vehicle.","rocket_id":"bfr","rocket_name":"Big Falcon Rocket","rocket_type":"rocket"}]'
