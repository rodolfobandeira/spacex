        2017, Iridium began launching Iridium NEXT, a second-generation worldwide
        network of telecommunications satellites, consisting of 66 active satellites,
        with another nine in-orbit spares and six on-ground spares. These satellites
        will incorporate features such as data transmission that were not emphasized
        in the original design. The constellation will provide L-band data speeds
        of up to 128 kbit/s to mobile terminals, up to 1.5 Mbit/s to Iridium Pilot
        marine terminals, and high-speed Ka-band service of up to 8 Mbit/s to fixed/transportable
        terminals. The next-generation terminals and service are expected to be commercially
        available by the end of 2018. However, Iridium''s proposed use of its next-generation
        satellites has raised concerns the service will harmfully interfere with GPS
        devices. The satellites will incorporate a secondary payload for Aireon, a
        space-qualified ADS-B data receiver. This is for use by air traffic control
        and, via FlightAware, for use by airlines. A tertiary payload on 58 satellites
        is a marine AIS ship-tracker receiver, for Canadian company exactEarth Ltd.
        Iridium can also be used to provide a data link to other satellites in space,
        enabling command and control of other space assets regardless of the position
        of ground stations and gateways."}'
